# NBA Superteam Frontend

Welcome to NBA Superteam App!  The application that allows the user to draft superteams with any players to ever play the game.  With this app, the user can create new teams for how many people they are drafting with and draft players to each team.  Team info includes a team name and roster.  Player info includes name, position and description.  At any point the user can delete a team and the team, along with the players on the teams roster, will be removed from the display.
